# Project-Euler
List of solved Project Euler problems. It's an overview of my problem solving skills progress. Many of provided solutions can be solved in more elegant way, but I have left all problems untouched, in their original form, so I can track my programming progress since the beginning. I will leave eventual algorithm upgrades for the upcoming fun weekends.
